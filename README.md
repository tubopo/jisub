+ Create required sub tasks with estimates for the parent ticket:

    jisub -st "BE:3 FE:4 QA:0.5" -f "storypoints:4 dealsize:3,4,0.5 label:New" JIRA-39106 
```

### Customizing Jira payload

To support various jira fields that may depend on configuration, payload templates are used.
This would allow to have your own jira mapping.

+ `issue.tmpl` - is used for the ticket fields update with the `--fields` flag.
+ `sub-tasks-bulk.tmpl` - is used for the sub tasks creation with the `--sub-tasks` flag.
